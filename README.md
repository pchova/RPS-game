This is a small game called Rock Paper Scissors, written in JavaScript. Pure JS only, can be played in the console. 

Finished RPS Game playable only in the console 4/1/2024.

Post Completion Reflection: 

-How to make functions and return values
-Called functions to a main function to play Rock, Paper, Scissors in playGame()
-looped over functions
-accepted user input and modified it to be lowercase
-parsing variables to integers 


Started RPS Game UI with JS 7/11/2024.
-changed playRound() to listen for a user to press a button for their choice
